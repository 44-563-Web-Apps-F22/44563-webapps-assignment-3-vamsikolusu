<h1> Nehru Memorial Museum & Library</h1>
<p>Fine house situating in a very pleasant garden.<br> 
    Lots to see associated with Nehru and there is the room in which he died.<br>
     The <strong>has been preserved</strong>  as he left it. Highly recommended.<br>
     A good hour's time spent going round the museum.<br>
      Interesting to learn more about the man, but wondered why tIhere was so much <strong>about Gandhi</strong> <br>
